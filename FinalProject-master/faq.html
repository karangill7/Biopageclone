		        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		        <h3>SHOULD I HIRE A PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST FOR MY WEDDING DAY?</h3>
		        <p>It is very important to hire a professional hair and makeup artist for your wedding day. A professional hair and makeup artist will make sure that your hair and makeup will last all day and photograph beautifully. Your wedding day is not a good day to risk doing your own makeup, or having a friend do it. Only a professionally trained artist will ensure that you will look and feel your absolute best on this very important day, that you will remember in your thoughts and photographs for years to come. Your makeup is particularly important to have done by an experienced professional. Everyday consumer brands of makeup will just not cut it on your wedding day, through the hugs, perspiration and tears. Consumer based brands are not meant for professional photography or video.</p>
		        <h3>HOW FAR IN ADVANCE SHOULD I BOOK YOU?</h3>
		        <p>I start booking up fo wedding season up to 18 months in advance.</p>
		        <h3>IS A DEPOSIT OR CONTRACT REQUIRED TO HOLD MY WEDDING DATE?</h3>
		        <p>Yes, a signed bridal contract and a $100 deposit is due on at the signing of the contract and is required in order to reserve your date. Be advised that no date will be reserved until the contract has been signed and the deposit has been paid. The deposit will be put towards your final bill and it non-refundable and non-transferable.</p>
		        <h3>WHAT BRANDS OF MAKEUP AND HAIR PRODUCTS DO YOU USE?</h3>
		        <p>All of the hair and  makeup products that I use are Professional Brands that were designed to give long lasting results and photograph beautifully. Please contact me if you would like more information on the brands carried.</p>
		        <h3>I DON'T WEAR A LOT OF MAKEUP, BUT I STILL WANT TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL ON MY WEDDING DAY. SHOULD I HIRE A PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST?</h3>
		        <p>Absolutely! You don't have to wear a lot of makeup on your wedding day to look beautiful, it just needs to be applied correctly and with the appropriate products. If you don't want to look too "made up" for your wedding, I can give you a very soft, natural bridal look. It is important on this day that your makeup last, looks great in photographs, makes you feel beautiful and is applied flawlessly to make you feel and look your best on this very special day.</p>
		        <h3>HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR PRODUCTS SANITARY?</h3>
		        <p>It is very important to make sure that the person you hire for your hair and makeup is sanitary. A good makeup artist will sanitize their hands right in front of you, have clean brushes, and a tidy makeup kit. I alaways begin applying makeup using cleaned and disinfected brushes and products. I have been professionally trained to know how to keep everything clean and sanitary. My brushes are cleaned befoe each work day, and cleaned with antibacterial brush cleaner between clients. I do not share lipsticks and other products between clients, they are always sanitized before use. All eyeshadows and eye/lip liners are disinfected with cosmetic sanitizer between usages as well.</p>
		        <h3>DO YOU PROVIDE ON-SITE SERVICES?</h3>
		        <p>Yes, I do! Why worry about getting yourself and all your party shuffled around and off to the event on time when I can come to you?! All wedding day services are all done on-site and bridal previews can be done either in studio or on-site, depending on your location. I can come to the event, hotel, your home, or wherever you are most comfortable and is the most convenient for you and your wedding party!</p>
		        <h3>DO YOU PROVIDE SERVICES FOR LARGE PARTIES?</h3>
		        <p>Yes, I can accommadate as many as possible before your photos, dpending on how early you are willing to start. If I will not have enough time to provide beauty services for your entire party myself, I may bring along aother professional stylist, if I have one available.</p>
		        <h3>ABOUT HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU TO DO EACH SERVICE?</h3>
		        <h3>BRIDE</h3>
		        <p>MAKEUP -60 MINUTES, HAIR -60 MINUTES</p>
		        <h3>BRIDESMAIDS/MOMS/OTHER</h3>
		        <p>MAKEUP -45 MINUTES, HAIR -45 MINUTES</p>
		        <p>ADDITIONAL SERVICES WILL TAKE EXTRA TIME (SUCH AS: LASHES, TATTOO COVER, HAIR EXTENSION APPLICATION, DUPATTA SETTING, JEWELRY SETTING, ETC). These are approximate times, and additional time may still need to be added into wedding day timelines.</p>
